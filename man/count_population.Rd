}
\arguments{
\item{geo_names}{required, vector of string(s) of geographical names}

\item{start_year}{optional, integer indicating the start year of observation.
2011 by default.}

\item{end_year}{optional, integer indicating the end year of observation.
2018 by default.}

\item{year}{optional, integer indicating a single year of observation.

zips <- c("94035","94039","94040","94041","94042","94043")

# Count the human population in the specified ZIP codes

# Count the human population from 2012 to 2015
